.. _SCORING:

=======
Scoring
=======

For this year's ARIAC competition, the scoring will be divided into 3 major sections:

.. container::

    1. **Base Score**: How well was the assigned task completed?
    2. **Bonus Score**: Various factors; how efficient and accurate is the created system?
    3. **Penalties**: Various sources; how often did the competitor perform an illegal action?

----------
Base Score
----------

The base score for the competition stems from the completion of tasks assigned in the run.
This would include the completion of both kits and moduels as a percentages of the requested number in the run.

.. container::

  .. math::

    S = ω_1 \cdot \frac{k_c}{k_d} + ω_2 \cdot \frac{m_c}{m_d}

Where: 

.. container::

    * S = the base score for the run
    * :math:`ω_1` = the weight associated with kit completion
    * :math:`k_c` = number of kits successfully completed 
    * :math:`k_d` = number of kits requested
    * :math:`ω_2` = the weight associated with module completion
    * :math:`m_c` = number of modules successfully completed 
    * :math:`m_d` = number of modules requested

------------
Bonus Points
------------

This years competition will allow competitors to acquire bonus points from a variety of sources. 
These sources include the following:

**Trial Time**

The trial time bonus is awarded for successfully completing the competition in less time than alloted.

.. container:: 

  .. math::

    β_1 = ω_3 \cdot (1 - \frac{t_e}{t_m})

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`β_1` = the total bonus for trial time
    * :math:`ω_3` = the weight associated with the trial time bonus
    * :math:`t_e` = run execution duration
    * :math:`t_m` = run time limit

**Inspection Speed**

The inspection speed bonus is awarded for submitting the inspection report in less time than needed.

.. container::

  .. math::

    β_2 = max [ 0 , ω_4 \cdot (1 - \frac{γ}{γ_d})]

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`β_2` = the total bonus for inspection speed
    * :math:`ω_4` = the weight associated with the inspection speed bonus
    * :math:`γ` = average inspection duration
    * :math:`γ_d` = desired inspection duration

**High Priority Order Speed**

The high priority order speed bonus is awarded for successfully completing high priority orders faster than the high priority time limit.

.. container::

  .. math::

    β_3 = max [ 0 , ω_5 \cdot (1 - \frac{τ}{τ_d})]

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`β_3` = the total bonus for high priority order speed
    * :math:`ω_5` = the weight associated with the high priority order speed bonus
    * :math:`τ` = average high priority kit execution duration
    * :math:`τ_d` = desired high priority kit execution duration

**Sensor Cost**

The sensor cost bonus is awarded for minimizing the cost of sensors competitors use to complete the competition. Going over budget results instead in a penalty.

.. container::

  .. math::

    β_4 = max [ 0 , ω_6 \cdot (1 - \frac{σ}{σ_b})]

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`β_4` = the total bonus for sensor cost
    * :math:`ω_6` = the weight associated with the sensor cost bonus
    * :math:`σ` = competitor sensor cost
    * :math:`σ_b` = sensor budget

**Inspection Classification**

The sensor cost bonus is awarded for minimizing the cost of sensors competitors use to complete the competition. Going over budget results instead in a penalty.

.. container::

  .. math::

    β_5 = ω_7 \cdot (1 - \frac{ν}{δ})

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`β_5` = the total bonus for inspection classification
    * :math:`ω_7` = the weight associated with the inspecton classification bonus
    * :math:`ν` = number of correctly classified reports
    * :math:`δ` = total number of defective cells

------------
Penalties
------------

This year's competition will incorporate penalties for certain events that occur during the competition.
All penalties are calculated per occurance, meaning that each penalty has an associated value, and each time
a penalty is recorded, that value will be deducted from the total score. The penalties come from the following sources:

* Non-defective cell is pushed into inspection bin
* Cell falls into conveyor bin
* Cell comes into contact with an invalid surface
* Two AGVs collide
* A robot collides, either with an object in the environment, or another robot
* The sensor cost used is over the provided budget

.. admonition:: Robot Collision Note
  :class: note
  :name: robot-collision

  For the robot collision, for every 3 seconds the robot is in collision, another occurance of the penalty will be recorded.
  In addition, if a robot is in collision with another robot, this penalty will be counted twice.

.. admonition:: Sensor Cost Note
  :class: note
  :name: sensor-over-budget

  For the sensor cost penalty, the penalty is calculated for each dollar over the provided budget. Using less than the provided
  budget will result in a bonus being applied to the score.

-----------
Total Score
-----------

In order to calculate the entire run score, the following formula can be used, combining the previous calculations:

.. container::

  .. math::

    R = S + \sum β_i - \sum ρ_i * o_i

Where:

.. container::

    * R = the total run score
    * S = the base score for the run
    * :math:`β_i` = the bonus scores
    * :math:`ρ_i` = the weights for each penalty type
    * :math:`o_i` = the number of occurances for the associated penalty
