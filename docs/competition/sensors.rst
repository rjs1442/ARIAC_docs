Sensor Overview
===============

In order to complete this year's ARIAC competition, we will be allowing competitors to use various sensors to gather information about the environment. The sensors being made available
to competitiors includes:

* Break Beam
* Distance Sensor
* RGB Camera
* LiDAR Sensor

Competitors are given a budget of $7000. Going over this budget will incur a penalty, but staying under will reward bonus points. More information about the associated bonus and 
penalty can be found on the :ref:`scoring page <scoring-anchor>`.

We will provide multiple tiers for each sensor, which includes an associated cost. The various sensors with their variants are explained further below.

**Break Beam**

The break beam will be offered with two variations, one which has an update rate of 10 Hz and one which has an update rate of 30 Hz. The break beam which has a 10 Hz update rate will 
cost $200, and the break beam which has an update rate of 30 Hz will cost $400.

**Distance Sensor**

The distance sensor will be offered with two variations, one which has an update rate of 10 Hz and one which has an update rate of 30 Hz. The sensor which has a 10 Hz update rate
will cost $300, and sensor which has an update rate of 30 Hz will cost $600.

**RGB Camera**

The camera will be offered with two variations, one which has a resolution of 720p and one which has a resolution of 1080p. The camera with a resolution of 720p will cost $500, and the
camera which has a resolution of 1080p will cost $800.

**LiDAR Sensor**

The LiDAR will be offered with three variations, explained in the table below:
